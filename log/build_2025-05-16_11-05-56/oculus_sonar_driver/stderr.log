[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmarine_acoustic_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "marine_acoustic_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "marine_acoustic_msgs" with any of the following names:

    marine_acoustic_msgsConfig.cmake
    marine_acoustic_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "marine_acoustic_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "marine_acoustic_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "marine_acoustic_msgs" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
